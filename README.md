## Space Attack

This is a short 1 minute game based on an outer space environment.
The main rocket has to hit the enemies using bullets. After 20 enemies, the Boss appears and the main character has to defeat the boss.
Movement is using the `up`, `down`, `right and `left` key and the `space` key is for shooting the bullets. 
Hope you enjoy this 1 minute game!
